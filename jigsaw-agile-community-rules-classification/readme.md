## 🧠 Reddit Comment Rule Violation Classifier

Welcome to the Reddit Comment Rule Violation Classifier – a machine learning project designed to detect whether a Reddit comment breaks a specific subreddit rule.

This project is part of a competition to support better content moderation by building binary classifiers that can predict if a comment violates subreddit-specific guidelines.

## 📌 Project Overview

Reddit moderators enforce community rules to maintain order and healthy discussion. However, each subreddit has its own unique set of rules, making moderation a complex task.

This project uses real-world Reddit comment data and a list of hypothetical rules (based on actual subreddit guidelines) to train a classifier that predicts whether a comment breaks a specific rule.

- **Goal:** Build a binary classifier to detect rule-violating comments.
- **Data:** Millions of unlabeled moderated comments + a small labeled dev set.
- **Labels:** Based on realistic subreddit rules.

This effort builds on research from Stanford and Georgia Tech, highlighting the potential for AI to support scalable, transparent content moderation.
